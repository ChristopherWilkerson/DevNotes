      Introduction to JavaScript
      Console
      4 min
      
      The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers. Much of the work the computer does with our code is invisible to us by default. If we want to see things appear on our screen, we can print, or log, to our console directly.
      
      In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can use in our code. Keywords are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer recognizes them and treats them specially.
      
      One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.
      
      It’s going to be very useful for us to print values to the console, so we can see the work that we’re doing.
      
      console.log(5);

Introduction to JavaScript
Properties
3 min

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. All data types have access to specific properties that are passed down to each instance. For example, every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5

The . is another operator! We call it the dot operator.

In the example above, the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the instance of the string, 'Hello'. The program prints 5 to the console, because Hello has five characters in it.

Let’s take one more glance at the concepts we just learned:

    Data is printed, or logged, to the console, a panel that displays messages, with console.log().
    We can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.
    There are 7 fundamental data types in JavaScript: strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, symbol, and object.
    Numbers are any number without quotes: 23.8879
    Strings are characters wrapped in single or double quotes: 'Sample String'
    The built-in arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and %.
    Objects, including instances of data types, can have properties, stored information. The properties are denoted with a . after the name of the object, for example: 'Hello'.length.
    Objects, including instances of data types, can have methods which perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a period, the method name, and parentheses. For example: 'hello'.toUpperCase().
    We can access properties and methods by using the ., dot operator.
    Built-in objects, including Math, are collections of methods and properties that JavaScript provides.

Variables
The Increment and Decrement Operator
2 min

Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:

let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11

let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19

Variables
String Interpolation
8 min

In the ES6 version of JavaScript, we can insert, or interpolate, variables into strings using template literals. Check out the following example where a template literal is used to log strings together:

const myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log(`I own a pet ${myPet}.`);
// Output: I own a pet armadillo.

Notice that:

    a template literal is wrapped by backticks ` (this key is usually located on the top of your keyboard, left of the 1 key).
    Inside the template literal, you’ll see a placeholder, ${myPet}. The value of myPet is inserted into the template literal.
    When we interpolate `I own a pet ${myPet}.`, the output we print is the string: 'I own a pet armadillo.'

One of the biggest benefits to using template literals is the readability of the code. Using template literals, you can more easily tell what the new string will be. You also don’t have to worry about escaping double quotes or single quotes.


## let myName = "Chris";
let myCity = "Seoul";
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. My favorite city is ${myCity}`)

Nice work! This lesson introduced you to variables, a powerful concept you will use in all your future programming endeavors.

Let’s review what we learned:

    Variables hold reusable data in a program and associate it with a name.
    Variables are stored in memory.
    The var keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
    let is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned, and const is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
    Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type undefined.
    Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.
    The + operator is used to concatenate strings including string values held in variables.
    In ES6, template literals use backticks ` and ${} to interpolate values into a string.
    The typeof keyword returns the data type (as a string) of a valu


example temperature celsius to fahrenheit

                              let celsius = 32;
                              // temp in celsius
                              let fahrenheit = Math.floor(celsius * (9/5) + 32);
                              // temp in fahrenheit 
                              console.log(`The temperature is ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit`)

Conditional Statements
If Statement
7 min

We often perform a task based on a condition. For example, if the weather is nice today, then we will go outside. If the alarm clock rings, then we’ll shut it off. If we’re tired, then we’ll go to sleep.

In programming, we can also perform a task based on a condition using an if statement:

if (true) {
  console.log('This message will print!'); 
}
// Prints: This message will print!

Notice in the example above, we have an if statement. The if statement is composed of:

    The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block, or block statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}.
    Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.
    If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
    If the condition evaluates to false, the block won’t execute.

Let’s make an if statement.


Conditional Statements
If...Else Statements
4 min

In the previous exercise, we used an if statement that checked a condition to decide whether or not to run a block of code. In many cases, we’ll have code we want to run if our condition evaluates to false.

If we wanted to add some default behavior to the if statement, we can add an else statement to run a block of code when the condition evaluates to false. Take a look at the inclusion of an else statement:

if (false) {
  console.log('The code in this block will not run.');
} else {
  console.log('But the code in this block will!');
}

// Prints: But the code in this block will!

An else statement must be paired with an if statement, and together they are referred to as an if...else statement.

In the example above, the else statement:

    Uses the else keyword following the code block of an if statement.
    Has a code block that is wrapped by a set of curly braces {}.
    The code inside the else statement code block will execute when the if statement’s condition evaluates to false.

if...else statements allow us to automate solutions to yes-or-no questions, also known as binary decisions.


Is equal to: ===
Is not equal to: !==

            let hungerLevel = 7;
            if (hungerLevel > 3) {
              console.log('Time to eat!')
            } else {
              console.log("We can eat later!");
            }

Logical Operators
10 min

Working with conditionals means that we will be using booleans, true or false values. In JavaScript, there are operators that work with boolean values known as logical operators. We can use logical operators to add more sophisticated logic to our conditionals. There are three logical operators:

    the and operator (&&)
    the or operator (||)
    the not operator, otherwise known as the bang operator (!)


Conditional Statements
Truthy and Falsy Assignment
8 min

Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of short-hand possibilities!

Say you have a website and want to take a user’s username to make a personalized greeting. Sometimes, the user does not have an account, making the username variable falsy. The code below checks if username is defined and assigns a default string if it is not:

let username = '';
let defaultName;

if (username) {
  defaultName = username;
} else {
  defaultName = 'Stranger';
}

console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger

If you combine your knowledge of logical operators you can use a short-hand for the code above. In a boolean condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the || operator in your assignment:

let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';

console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger

Because || or statements check the left-hand condition first, the variable defaultName will be assigned the actual value of username if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of 'Stranger' if username is falsy. This concept is also referred to as short-circuit evaluation.


Ternary Operator
10 min

In the spirit of using short-hand syntax, we can use a ternary operator to simplify an if...else statement.

Take a look at the if...else statement example:

let isNightTime = true;

if (isNightTime) {
  console.log('Turn on the lights!');
} else {
  console.log('Turn off the lights!');
}

We can use a ternary operator to perform the same functionality:

isNightTime ? console.log('Turn on the lights!') : console.log('Turn off the lights!');


let isLocked = false;

isLocked ? console.log('You will need a key to open the door.') : console.log('You will not need a key to open the door.');

let isCorrect = true;

isCorrect ? console.log('Correct!') : console.log('Incorrect!');

let favoritePhrase = 'Love That!';

favoritePhrase === 'Love That!' ? console.log('I love that!') : console.log("I don't love that!");



Conditional Statements
The switch keyword
11 min

else if statements are a great tool if we need to check multiple conditions. In programming, we often find ourselves needing to check multiple values and handling each of them differently. For example:

let groceryItem = 'papaya';

if (groceryItem === 'tomato') {
  console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
} else if (groceryItem === 'papaya'){
  console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
} else {
  console.log('Invalid item');
}

In the code above, we have a series of conditions checking for a value that matches a groceryItem variable. Our code works fine, but imagine if we needed to check 100 different values! Having to write that many else if statements sounds like a pain!

A switch statement provides an alternative syntax that is easier to read and write. A switch statement looks like this:

let groceryItem = 'papaya';

switch (groceryItem) {
  case 'tomato':
    console.log('Tomatoes are $0.49');
    break;
  case 'lime':
    console.log('Limes are $1.49');
    break;
  case 'papaya':
    console.log('Papayas are $1.29');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('Invalid item');
    break;
}

// Prints 'Papayas are $1.29'

    The switch keyword initiates the statement and is followed by ( ... ), which contains the value that each case will compare. In the example, the value or expression of the switch statement is groceryItem.
    Inside the block, { ... }, there are multiple cases. The case keyword checks if the expression matches the specified value that comes after it. The value following the first case is 'tomato'. If the value of groceryItem equalled 'tomato', that case‘s console.log() would run.
    The value of groceryItem is 'papaya', so the third case runs— Papayas are $1.29 is logged to the console.
    The break keyword tells the computer to exit the block and not execute any more code or check any other cases inside the code block. Note: Without break keywords, the first matching case will run, but so will every subsequent case regardless of whether or not it matches—including the default. This behavior is different from if/else conditional statements that execute only one block of code.
    At the end of each switch statement, there is a default statement. If none of the cases are true, then the code in the default statement will run.

            if (runnerAge > 18 && runnerEarly) {
              raceNumber += 1000
            }
            if (runnerAge > 18 && runnerEarly) {
              console.log(`You will race at 9:30a. Your race number is ${raceNumber}`)
            } else if (runnerAge > 18 && !runnerEarly) {
              console.log(`You will race at 11:00a. Your race number is ${raceNumber}`)
            } else if (runnerAge < 18) {
              console.log(`You will race at 12:30pm. Your race number is ${raceNumber}`)
            } else {
              console.log("See official before start.")

      Functions
Calling a Function
5 min

As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it just declares the existence of the function. The code inside a function body runs, or executes, only when the function is called.

To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.
Diagram showing the syntax of invoking a function

This function call executes the function body, or all of the statements between the curly braces in the function declaration. Function execution diagram

We can call the same function as many times as needed.

Let’s practice calling functions in our code.


Functions
Parameters and Arguments
8 min

So far, the functions we’ve created execute a task without an input. However, some functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a task. When declaring a function, we can specify its parameters. Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called.

Let’s observe how to specify parameters in our function declaration:
JavaScript syntax for declaring a function with parameters

In the diagram above, calculateArea(), computes the area of a rectangle, based on two inputs, width and height. The parameters are specified between the parenthesis as width and height, and inside the function body, they act just like regular variables. width and height act as placeholders for values that will be multiplied together. 



simple rectangular area functin
function area_rect(width, height) {
  console.log(width * height)
}
area_rect(2119, 5123)



**** Functions
Default Parameters
5 min

One of the features added in ES6 is the ability to use default parameters. Default parameters allow parameters to have a predetermined value in case there is no argument passed into the function or if the argument is undefined when called.

Take a look at the code snippet below that uses a default parameter:

function greeting (name = 'stranger') {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

greeting('Nick') // Output: Hello, Nick!
greeting() // Output: Hello, stranger!

    In the example above, we used the = operator to assign the parameter name a default value of 'stranger'. This is useful to have in case we ever want to include a non-personalized default greeting!

    When the code calls greeting('Nick') the value of the argument is passed in and, 'Nick', will override the default parameter of 'stranger' to log 'Hello, Nick!' to the console.

    When there isn’t an argument passed into greeting(), the default value of 'stranger' is used, and 'Hello, stranger!' is logged to the console.

By using a default parameter, we account for situations when an argument isn’t passed into a function that is expecting an argument.

Functions
Function Expressions
13 min

Another way to define a function is to use a function expression. To define a function inside an expression, we can use the function keyword. In a function expression, the function name is usually omitted. A function with no name is called an anonymous function. A function expression is often stored in a variable in order to refer to it.

Consider the following function expression:
defining a function expression

To declare a function expression:

    Declare a variable to make the variable’s name be the name, or identifier, of your function. Since the release of ES6, it is common practice to use const as the keyword to declare the variable.

    Assign as that variable’s value an anonymous function created by using the function keyword followed by a set of parentheses with possible parameters. Then a set of curly braces that contain the function body.

To invoke a function expression, write the name of the variable in which the function is stored followed by parentheses enclosing any arguments being passed into the function.

variableName(argument1, argument2)

Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted so they cannot be called before they are defined.

Let’s define a new function using a function expression.


Functions
Arrow Functions
3 min

ES6 introduced arrow function syntax, a shorter way to write functions by using the special “fat arrow” () => notation.

Arrow functions remove the need to type out the keyword function every time you need to create a function. Instead, you first include the parameters inside the ( ) and then add an arrow => that points to the function body surrounded in { } like this:

const rectangleArea = (width, height) => {
  let area = width * height;
  return area;
};

It’s important to be familiar with the multiple ways of writing functions because you will come across each of these when reading other JavaScript code.


Functions
Concise Body Arrow Functions
5 min

JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor arrow function syntax. The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body. We’ll explore a few of these techniques below:

    Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.
    showcasing how arrow functions parameters differ for different amounts of parameters

    A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. This is referred to as implicit return.

comparing single line and multiline arrow functions

So if we have a function:

const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};

We can refactor the function to:

const squareNum = num => num * num;

Notice the following changes:

    The parentheses around num have been removed, since it has a single parameter.
    The curly braces { } have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
    The return keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.

Review: Scope
1 min

In this lesson, you learned about scope and how it impacts the accessibility of different variables.

Let’s review the following terms:

    Scope refers to where variables can be accessed throughout the program, and is determined by where and how they are declared.
    Blocks are statements that exist within curly braces {}.
    Global scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible to every part of the program.
    Global variables are variables that exist within global scope.
    Block scope refers to the context within which variables are accessible only within the block they are defined.
    Local variables are variables that exist within block scope.
    Global namespace is the space in our code that contains globally scoped information.
    Scope pollution is when too many variables exist in a namespace or variable names are reused.

As you continue your coding journey, remember to use best practices when declaring your variables! Scoping your variables tightly will ensure that your code has clean, organized, and modular logic.

Command + Opt + K to run javascript console in browser


## Node.js

Note the following syntax rules for JSON:

    The curly braces, {..}, hold objects.
    The square brackets, [..], hold arrays.
    Data is stored in name-value pairs separated by a colon, :.
    Every name-value pair is separated from another pair by a comma, ,. Similarly, every item in an array is delimited by a comma as well. Trailing commas are forbidden.
    JSON property names must be in double-quoted (" ") text even though JavaScript names do not hold by this stringency.


What Is JSON?

A brief guide to understanding JSON and its use cases.
Introduction

In a world inundated with data, it is becoming more important to know how to work with a variety of data. As programmers, we need to be able to transfer our populated data structures from any language we choose to a format that is recognizable and readable by other languages and platforms. Fortunately for us, there exists such a data-exchange format.
What is JSON?

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a popular, language-independent, standard format for storing and exchanging data. Adopted by ECMA International, an industry association founded in 1961 to standardize information and communication systems, JSON has become the de facto standard that facilitates storing and sending data between all programming languages.
Common Uses of JSON

JSON is heavily used to facilitate data transfer in web applications between a client, such as a web browser, and a server. A typical example where such data transfer occurs is when you fill out a web form. The form data is converted from HTML to JavaScript objects to JSON objects and sent to a remote web server for processing. These transactions could be as simple as entering a search engine query to a multi-page job application.

When companies make their data public for other applications, like Spotify sharing its music library or Google sharing its map data, the information is formatted in JSON. This way, any application, regardless of language, can collect and parse the data.

Some of the popular web APIs that utilize JSON in data exchanges are:

    Google Maps
    Google Auth 2.0 Authentication
    Facebook Social Graph API
    Spotify Music Web API
    LinkedIn Profile API

JSON Syntax

Since JSON is derived from the JavaScript programming language, its appearance is similar to that of JavaScript objects.

A sample JSON object is represented as follows:

{
  "student": {
    "name": "Rumaisa Mahoney",
    "age": 30,
    "fullTime": true,
    "languages": [ "JavaScript", "HTML", "CSS" ],
    "GPA": 3.9,
    "favoriteSubject": null
  }
}

Note the following syntax rules for JSON:

    The curly braces, {..}, hold objects.
    The square brackets, [..], hold arrays.
    Data is stored in name-value pairs separated by a colon, :.
    Every name-value pair is separated from another pair by a comma, ,. Similarly, every item in an array is delimited by a comma as well. Trailing commas are forbidden.
    JSON property names must be in double-quoted (" ") text even though JavaScript names do not hold by this stringency.

JSON Data Types

A JSON data type must be one of the following:

    string (double-quoted)
    number (integer or floating point)
    object (name-value pair)
    array (comma-delimited)
    boolean (true or false)
    null


By default, you indicate the input is ready for eval when you hit enter. If you’d like to type multiple lines and then have them evaluated at once, you can type .editor while in the REPL. Once in “editor” mode, you can type control + d when you’re ready for the input to be evaluated. Each session of the REPL has a single shared memory; you can access any variables or functions you define until you exit the REPL.

Core Modules
6 min

Modularity is a software design technique where one program has distinct parts, each providing a single piece of the overall functionality. These separate modules come together to build a cohesive whole. Modularity is essential for creating scalable programs which incorporate libraries and frameworks and separate the program’s concerns into manageable chunks. Essentially, a module is a collection of code located in a file. Instead of having an entire program located in a single file, code is organized into separate files based on the concerns they address. These files can then be included in other files by using the require() function.

To save developers from reinventing the wheel each time, Node.js has several built-in modules to perform common tasks efficiently. These are known as the core modules. The core modules are defined within Node.js’s source code and are located in the lib/ folder. Core modules can be required by passing a string with the name of the module into the require() function:

// Require in the 'events' core module:
const events = require('events');

The example above shows how the events module is required into a file and stored in an events variable. Understanding the specifics of this module isn’t necessary at this point, but the events module is a Node.js core module that provides key functions for working with, well… events. You’ll learn more about it in a later lesson. 

Once in the REPL, a complete list of core modules can be accessed by typing the command:

require('module').builtinModules

As you can see, there are many modules already built into Node.js and ready to be utilized! In the next few exercises, we’ll explore some of the more useful ones in further detail.

Introduction to Node.js
The OS Module
11 min

When developing or debugging an app, it can be helpful to have information about the computer, operating system, and network on which the program is running. Before Node, this information could not be retrieved using JavaScript due to the language being confined to the browser. However, Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, which means it can execute code outside of the browser, and we’re able to get access to much of this information through the os core module.

Unlike process and console, the os module is not global and needs to be included into the file in order to gain access to its methods. You can include the os module into your file by typing:

const os = require('os');

With the os module saved to the os variable, you can call methods like:

    os.type() — to return the computer’s operating system.
    os.arch() — to return the operating system CPU architecture.
    os.networkInterfaces() — to return information about the network interfaces of the computer, such as IP and MAC address.
    os.homedir() — to return the current user’s home directory.
    os.hostname() — to return the hostname of the operating system.
    os.uptime() — to return the system uptime, in seconds.

Let’s take a look at an example:

const os = require('os');

const local = {  
  'Home Directory': os.homedir(),    
  'Operating System': os.type(),
  'Last Reboot': os.uptime()
}

In the above example code, we first require the os module and store it in a variable, os. Below that, we have an object, local, that will hold some information about the user’s computer: the name of the home directory, the type of operating system, and the time since the computer was last rebooted.

  {
    'Home Directory': '/Users/luca',
    'Operating System': 'Darwin',
    'Time since reboot': 86997
  }

When we run the program, the local object stores all the requested information:

    the user’s home directory — '/Users/luca',
    the operating system — 'Darwin' (Darwin is the underlying operating system of macOS.),
    and the time since the computer was last rebooted — 86997 seconds.
Introduction to Node.js
The Util Module
22 min

Developers sometimes classify outlier functions used to maintain code and debug certain aspects of a program’s functionality as utility functions. Utility functions don’t necessarily create new functionality in a program, but you can think of them as internal tools used to maintain and debug your code. The Node.js util core module contains methods specifically designed for these purposes. The util module can be required into the file using:

const util = require('util');

Once required, you have access to many useful objects and methods within the util module. One important object is types, which provides methods for runtime type checking in Node.

const util = require('util');

const today = new Date();
const earthDay = 'April 22, 2022';

console.log(util.types.isDate(today));
console.log(util.types.isDate(earthDay));

In the above example, we first require in the util module. Next, we declare two variables: today stores today’s date as an instance of the Date object, and earthDay stores the date of Earth Day as a string. We then log the results of type checking each variable using util.types.isDate(). The types.isDate() method checks for Date objects and returns a boolean value, giving us:

true
false

Since today is a Date object, it returns true, and since earthDay is a string, it returns false!

Another important util method is .promisify(), which turns callback functions into promises. As you know, asynchronous programming is essential to Node.js. In the beginning, this asynchrony was achieved using error-first callback functions, which are still very prevalent in the Node ecosystem today. But since promises are often preferred over callbacks and especially nested callbacks, Node offers a way to turn these into promises. Let’s take a look:

function getUser (id, callback) {
  return setTimeout(() => {
    if (id === 5) {
      callback(null, { nickname: 'Teddy' })
    } else {
      callback(new Error('User not found'))
    }
  }, 1000)
}

function callback (error, user) {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error.message)
    process.exit(1)
  }

  console.log(`User found! Their nickname is: ${user.nickname}`)
}

getUser(1, callback) // -> `User not found`
getUser(5, callback) // -> `User found! Their nickname is: Teddy`

Here we have a function that queries a database for a specified user ID. getUser methods are very common in back-end applications, and most will also support error-first callbacks. Since a database query typically takes longer to run than other operations, we simulate the query with a setTimeout() method that executes a callback function after 1000 milliseconds (or 1 second). If the user with the specified ID is found, the callback function is executed with null passed in as the argument for the error parameter, and an object containing the returned user information is passed in as an argument for the user parameter. If the user is not found, the callback function is executed, passing in a new Error as the argument for the error parameter. A second argument for user is not necessary since the function will end in the case of an error.

This way of handling this function may seem a bit convoluted these days, but with .promisify(), we can easily change it into a modern, cleaner, and more maintainable version of itself:

const getUserPromise = util.promisify(getUser);

getUserPromise(id)
  .then((user) => {
      console.log(`User found! Their nickname is: ${user.nickname}`);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
      console.log('User not found', error);
  });

getUser(1) // -> `User not found`
getUser(5) // -> `User found! Their nickname is: Teddy`

We declare a getUserPromise variable that stores the getUser method turned into a promise using the .promisify() method. With that in place, we’re able to use getUserPromise with .then() and .catch() methods (or we could also use the async...await syntax here) to resolve the promise returned or catch any errors.

Now, this is an extremely simplified example, but it’s helpful to recognize how to use this important tool when you start working with more complex callback functions

Arrays
Update Elements
3 min

In the previous exercise, you learned how to access elements inside an array or a string by using an index. Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.

let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];

seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
console.log(seasons); 
//Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']

In the example above, the seasons array contained the names of the four seasons.

However, we decided that we preferred to say 'Autumn' instead of 'Fall'.

The line, seasons[3] = 'Autumn'; tells our program to change the item at index 3 of the seasons array to be 'Autumn' instead of what is already there.

Loops
The For Loop
6 min

Instead of writing out the same code over and over, loops allow us to tell computers to repeat a given block of code on its own. One way to give computers these instructions is with a for loop.

The typical for loop includes an iterator variable that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but it’s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.

A for loop contains three expressions separated by ; inside the parentheses:

    an initialization starts the loop and can also be used to declare the iterator variable.
    a stopping condition is the condition that the iterator variable is evaluated against— if the condition evaluates to true the code block will run, and if it evaluates to false the code will stop.
    an iteration statement is used to update the iterator variable on each loop.

The for loop syntax looks like this:

for (let counter = 0; counter < 4; counter++) {
  console.log(counter);
}

In this example, the output would be the following:

0
1
2
3

Let’s break down the example:

    The initialization is let counter = 0, so the loop will start counting at 0.
    The stopping condition is counter < 4, meaning the loop will run as long as the iterator variable, counter, is less than 4.
    The iteration statement is counter++. This means after each loop, the value of counter will increase by 1. For the first iteration counter will equal 0, for the second iteration counter will equal 1, and so on.
    The code block is inside of the curly braces, console.log(counter), will execute until the condition evaluates to false. The condition will be false when counter is greater than or equal to 4 — the point that the condition becomes false is sometimes called the stop condition.

This for loop makes it possible to write 0, 1, 2, and 3 programmatically.

                    console.log(`I would love to visit ${vacationSpots[i]}`);
                        }

Nested loop example to compare arrays with same values

                        const tinasFollowers = ["Mike", "Leslie", "Ellum", "MiYoung"];
                        mutualFollowers = [];
                        for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {
                            for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {
                                if (bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]) {
                                    mutualFollowers.push(tinasFollowers[j]);
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        console.log(mutualFollowers);

                        returns "Mike"

Loops
The While Loop
12 min

You’re doing great! We’re going to teach you about a different type of loop: the while loop. To start, let’s convert a for loop into a while loop:

// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++){
  console.log(counterOne);
}

// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;
}

Let’s break down what’s happening with our while loop syntax:

    The counterTwo variable is declared before the loop. We can access it inside our while loop since it’s in the global scope.
    We start our loop with the keyword while followed by our stopping condition, or test condition. This will be evaluated before each round of the loop. While the condition evaluates to true, the block will continue to run. Once it evaluates to false the loop will stop.
    Next, we have our loop’s code block which prints counterTwo to the console and increments counterTwo.

What would happen if we didn’t increment counterTwo inside our block? If we didn’t include this, counterTwo would always have its initial value, 1. That would mean the testing condition counterTwo < 4 would always evaluate to true and our loop would never stop running! Remember, this is called an infinite loop and it’s something we always want to avoid. Infinite loops can take up all of your computer’s processing power potentially freezing your computer.

So you may be wondering when to use a while loop! The syntax of a while loop is ideal when we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should run. Think of eating like a while loop: when you start taking bites, you don’t know the exact number you’ll need to become full. Rather you’ll eat while you’re hungry. In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.



Loops
Do...While Statements
11 min

In some cases, you want a piece of code to run at least once and then loop based on a specific condition after its initial run. This is where the do...while statement comes in.

A do...while statement says to do a task once and then keep doing it until a specified condition is no longer met. The syntax for a do...while statement looks like this:

let countString = '';
let i = 0;

do {
  countString = countString + i;
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

console.log(countString);

In this example, the code block makes changes to the countString variable by appending the string form of the i variable to it. First, the code block after the do keyword is executed once. Then the condition is evaluated. If the condition evaluates to true, the block will execute again. The looping stops when the condition evaluates to false.

Note that the while and do...while loop are different! Unlike the while loop, do...while will run at least once whether or not the condition evaluates to true.

const firstMessage = 'I will print!';
const secondMessage = 'I will not print!'; 

// A do while with a stopping condition that evaluates to false
do {
 console.log(firstMessage)
} while (true === false);

// A while loop with a stopping condition that evaluates to false
while (true === false){
  console.log(secondMessage)
};


using break and array value 
                  const rapperArray = ["Lil' Kim", "Jay-Z", "Notorious B.I.G.", "Tupac"];
                  
                  // Write your code below
                  for (let i = 0; i < rapperArray.length; i++) {
                      console.log(rapperArray[i]);
                      if (rapperArray[i] === 'Notorious B.I.G.') {
                        break;
                      }
                  }
                  console.log("And if you don't know, now you know.");


for loop vs for…of loop

Here is an example of iterating over each element in an array using a traditional for loop with an index variable:

const hobbies = ['singing', 'eating', 'quidditch', 'writing'];
 
for (let i = 0; i < hobbies.length; i++) {
  console.log(`I enjoy ${hobbies[i]}.`);
}


And here is an example of iterating through the same array using a for...of loop:

const hobbies = ['singing', 'eating', 'quidditch', 'writing'];
 
for (const hobby of hobbies) {
  console.log(`I enjoy ${hobby}.`);
}

Iterating Through a String

The for...of can also be used to iterate over strings. Here is an example:

const username = 'joe';
 
for (const char of username) {
  console.log(char);
}

Objects
Accessing Properties
4 min

There are two ways we can access an object’s property. Let’s explore the first way— dot notation, ..

You’ve used dot notation to access the properties and methods of built-in objects and data instances:

'hello'.length; // Returns 5

With property dot notation, we write the object’s name, followed by the dot operator and then the property name (key):

let spaceship = {
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  color: 'silver'
};
spaceship.homePlanet; // Returns 'Earth',
spaceship.color; // Returns 'silver',

If we try to access a property that does not exist on that object, undefined will be returned.

spaceship.favoriteIcecream; // Returns undefined

Let’s get some more practice using dot notation on an object!

Objects
Property Assignment
8 min

Once we’ve defined an object, we’re not stuck with all the properties we wrote. Objects are mutable meaning we can update them after we create them!

We can use either dot notation, ., or bracket notation, [], and the assignment operator, = to add new key-value pairs to an object or change an existing property.

diagram showing how an object followed by brackets ([]) with the property name as a string can be reassigned to a new value. This same idea applies for accessing a property using dot notation which has the object name, followed by a dot and the name of the property

One of two things can happen with property assignment:

    If the property already exists on the object, whatever value it held before will be replaced with the newly assigned value.
    If there was no property with that name, a new property will be added to the object.

It’s important to know that although we can’t reassign an object declared with const, we can still mutate it, meaning we can add new properties and change the properties that are there.

const spaceship = {type: 'shuttle'};
spaceship = {type: 'alien'}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
spaceship.type = 'alien'; // Changes the value of the type property
spaceship.speed = 'Mach 5'; // Creates a new key of 'speed' with a value of 'Mach 5'

You can delete a property from an object with the delete operator.

const spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  mission: 'Explore the universe' 
};
 
delete spaceship.mission;  // Removes the mission property

Objects
Methods
10 min

When the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method. A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.

Do object methods seem familiar? That’s because you’ve been using them all along! For example console is a global JavaScript object and .log() is a method on that object. Math is also a global JavaScript object and .floor() is a method on it. 



We can include methods in our object literals by creating ordinary, colon-separated key-value pairs. The key serves as our method’s name, while the value is an anonymous function expression.

const alienShip = {
  invade: function () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};

With the new method syntax introduced in ES6 we can omit the colon and the function keyword.

const alienShip = {
  invade () { 
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.')
  }
};

Object methods are invoked by appending the object’s name with the dot operator followed by the method name and parentheses:

alienShip.invade(); // Prints 'Hello! We have come to dominate your planet. Instead of Earth, it shall be called New Xaculon.'

Looping Through Objects
15 min

Loops are programming tools that repeat a block of code until a condition is met. We learned how to iterate through arrays using their numerical indexing, but the key-value pairs in objects aren’t ordered! JavaScript has given us alternative solution for iterating through objects with the for...in syntax .

for...in will execute a given block of code for each property in an object.

let spaceship = {
  crew: {
    captain: { 
      name: 'Lily', 
      degree: 'Computer Engineering', 
      cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') } 
    },
    'chief officer': { 
      name: 'Dan', 
      degree: 'Aerospace Engineering', 
      agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') } 
    },
    medic: { 
      name: 'Clementine', 
      degree: 'Physics', 
      announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
      name: 'Shauna', 
      degree: 'Conservation Science', 
      powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') } 
    }
  }
}; 

// for...in
for (let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
  console.log(`${crewMember}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}`);
}

Our for...in will iterate through each element of the spaceship.crew object. In each iteration, the variable crewMember is set to one of spaceship.crew‘s keys, enabling us to log a list of crew members’ role and name.



Objects
Review
<1 min

Way to go! You’re well on your way to understanding the mechanics of objects in JavaScript. By building your own objects, you will have a better understanding of how JavaScript built-in objects work as well. You can also start imagining organizing your code into objects and modeling real world things in code.

Let’s review what we learned in this lesson:

    Objects store collections of key-value pairs.
    Each key-value pair is a property—when a property is a function it is known as a method.
    An object literal is composed of comma-separated key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces.
    You can access, add or edit a property within an object by using dot notation or bracket notation.
    We can add methods to our object literals using key-value syntax with anonymous function expressions as values or by using the new ES6 method syntax.
    We can navigate complex, nested objects by chaining operators.
    Objects are mutable—we can change their properties even when they’re declared with const.
    Objects are passed by reference— when we make changes to an object passed into a function, those changes are permanent.
    We can iterate through objects using the For...in syntax.


Advanced Objects
The this Keyword
12 min

Objects are collections of related data and functionality. We store that functionality in methods on our objects:

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  }
};

In our goat object we have a .makeSound() method. We can invoke the .makeSound() method on goat.

goat.makeSound(); // Prints baaa

Nice, we have a goat object that can print baaa to the console. Everything seems to be working fine. What if we wanted to add a new method to our goat object called .diet() that prints the goat‘s dietType?

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(dietType);
  }
};
goat.diet(); 
// Output will be "ReferenceError: dietType is not defined"

That’s strange, why is dietType not defined even though it’s a property of goat? That’s because inside the scope of the .diet() method, we don’t automatically have access to other properties of the goat object.

Here’s where the this keyword comes to the rescue. If we change the .diet() method to use the this, the .diet() works! :

const goat = {
  dietType: 'herbivore',
  makeSound() {
    console.log('baaa');
  },
  diet() {
    console.log(this.dietType);
  }
};

goat.diet(); 
// Output: herbivore

The this keyword references the calling object which provides access to the calling object’s properties. In the example above, the calling object is goat and by using this we’re accessing the goat object itself, and then the dietType property of goat by using property dot notation.

Let’s get comfortable using the this keyword in a method.

Privacy
6 min

Accessing and updating properties is fundamental in working with objects. However, there are cases in which we don’t want other code simply accessing and updating an object’s properties. When discussing privacy in objects, we define it as the idea that only certain properties should be mutable or able to change in value.

Certain languages have privacy built-in for objects, but JavaScript does not have this feature. Rather, JavaScript developers follow naming conventions that signal to other developers how to interact with a property. One common convention is to place an underscore _ before the name of a property to mean that the property should not be altered. Here’s an example of using _ to prepend a property.

const bankAccount = {
  _amount: 1000
}

In the example above, the _amount is not intended to be directly manipulated. 

Advanced Objects
Getters
15 min

Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property! Let’s take a look at a getter method:

const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  }
}

// To call the getter method: 
person.fullName; // 'John Doe'

Notice that in the getter method above:

    We use the get keyword followed by a function.
    We use an if...else conditional to check if both _firstName and _lastName exist (by making sure they both return truthy values) and then return a different value depending on the result.
    We can access the calling object’s internal properties using this. In fullName, we’re accessing both this._firstName and this._lastName.
    In the last line we call fullName on person. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re accessing a property.

Now that we’ve gone over syntax, let’s discuss some notable advantages of using getter methods:

    Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
    Getters can return different values using conditionals.
    In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
    The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.

Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the same name as the getter/setter function. If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name like we did in the example above.

Great, let’s go getter!


Advanced Objects
Setters
13 min

Along with getter methods, we can also create setter methods which reassign values of existing properties within an object. Let’s see an example of a setter method:

const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
};

Notice that in the example above:

    We can perform a check for what value is being assigned to this._age.
    When we use the setter method, only values that are numbers will reassign this._age
    There are different outputs depending on what values are used to reassign this._age.

Then to use the setter method:

person.age = 40;
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 40
person.age = '40'; // Logs: You must assign a number to age

Setter methods like age do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re reassigning the value of a property.

Like getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties. For example, in the example above, we can still set ._age directly:

person._age = 'forty-five'
console.log(person._age); // Prints forty-five

Factory Functions
11 min

So far we’ve been creating objects individually, but there are times where we want to create many instances of an object quickly. Here’s where factory functions come in. A real world factory manufactures multiple copies of an item quickly and on a massive scale. A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances. Factory functions can also have parameters allowing us to customize the object that gets returned.

Let’s say we wanted to create an object to represent monsters in JavaScript. There are many different types of monsters and we could go about making each monster individually but we can also use a factory function to make our lives easier. To achieve this diabolical plan of creating multiple monsters objects, we can use a factory function that has parameters:

const monsterFactory = (name, age, energySource, catchPhrase) => {
  return { 
    name: name,
    age: age, 
    energySource: energySource,
    scare() {
      console.log(catchPhrase);
    } 
  }
};

In the monsterFactory function above, it has four parameters and returns an object that has the properties: name, age, energySource, and scare(). To make an object that represents a specific monster like a ghost, we can call monsterFactory with the necessary arguments and assign the return value to a variable:

const ghost = monsterFactory('Ghouly', 251, 'ectoplasm', 'BOO!');
ghost.scare(); // 'BOO!'

Now we have a ghost object as a result of calling monsterFactory() with the needed arguments. With monsterFactory in place, we don’t have to create an object literal every time we need a new monster. Instead, we can invoke the monsterFactory function with the necessary arguments to take over the world make a monster for us!

Advanced Objects
Destructured Assignment
6 min

We often want to extract key-value pairs from objects and save them as variables. Take for example the following object:

const vampire = {
  name: 'Dracula',
  residence: 'Transylvania',
  preferences: {
    day: 'stay inside',
    night: 'satisfy appetite'
  }
};

If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could use the following code:

const residence = vampire.residence; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania' 

However, we can also take advantage of a destructuring technique called destructured assignment to save ourselves some keystrokes. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an object’s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object. Take a look at the example below:

const { residence } = vampire; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'

Look back at the vampire object’s properties in the first code example. Then, in the example above, we declare a new variable residence that extracts the value of the residence property of vampire. When we log the value of residence to the console, 'Transylvania' is printed.

We can even use destructured assignment to grab nested properties of an object:

const { day } = vampire.preferences; 
console.log(day); // Prints 'stay inside'

Instructions

    Checkpoint 1 Passed

    1.

    Use destructured assignment to create a const variable named functionality that extracts the functionality property of robot.

    If you need a reminder on how to use destructured assignment, review the example in the narrative or check the hint.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Since functionality is referencing robot.functionality we can call the methods available to robot.functionality simply through functionality.

Take advantage of this shortcut and call the .beep() method on functionality.

You can think of functionality as the object that was pulled out of robot.functionality. To call .beep(), use dot notation with the name of the method and a set of parentheses:

functionality.beep();


Advanced Objects
Review
<1 min

Congratulations on finishing Advanced Objects!

Let’s review the concepts covered in this lesson:

    The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.
    The this keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.
    Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.
    The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.
    We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.
    JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.
    The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.
    Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.
    Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.
    There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.
    As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!

You’re ready to start leveraging more elegant code for creating and accessing objects in your code!

Higher-Order Functions
Functions as Parameters
16 min

As you know, a parameter is a placeholder for the data that gets passed into a function. Since functions can behave like any other type of data in JavaScript, it might not surprise you to learn that functions can accept other functions as parameters. A higher-order function is a function that either accepts functions as parameters, returns a function, or both! We call functions that get passed in as parameters callback functions. Callback functions get invoked during the execution of the higher-order function.

When we invoke a higher-order function, and pass another function in as an argument, we don’t invoke the argument function. Invoking it would evaluate to passing in the return value of that function call. With callback functions, we pass in the function itself by typing the function name without the parentheses:

const higherOrderFunc = param => {
  param();
  return `I just invoked ${param.name} as a callback function!`
}
 
const anotherFunc = () => {
  return 'I\'m being invoked by the higher-order function!';
}

higherOrderFunc(anotherFunc);

We wrote a higher-order function higherOrderFunc that accepts a single parameter, param. Inside the body, param gets invoked using parentheses. And finally, a string is returned, telling us the name of the callback function that was passed in.

Below the higher-order function, we have another function aptly named anotherFunc. This function aspires to be called inside the higher-order function.

Lastly, we invoke higherOrderFunc(), passing in anotherFunc as its argument, thus fulfilling its dreams of being called by the higher-order function.

higherOrderFunc(() => {
  for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
  }
});

In this example, we invoked higherOrderFunc() with an anonymous function (a function without a name) that counts to 10. Anonymous functions can be arguments too!

Let’s get some practice writing higher-order functions.

Iterators
Introduction to Iterators
3 min

Imagine you had a grocery list and you wanted to know what each item on the list was. You’d have to scan through each row and check for the item. This common task is similar to what we have to do when we want to iterate over, or loop through, an array. One tool at our disposal is the for loop. However, we also have access to built-in array methods which make looping easier.

The built-in JavaScript array methods that help us iterate are called iteration methods, at times referred to as iterators. Iterators are methods called on arrays to manipulate elements and return values.

In this lesson, you will learn the syntax for these methods, their return values, how to use the documentation to understand them, and how to choose the right iterator method for a given task.



const artists = ['Picasso', 'Kahlo', 'Matisse', 'Utamaro'];

artists.forEach(artist => {
  console.log(artist + ' is one of my favorite artists.');
});

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squareNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squareNumbers);

const things = ['desk', 'chair', 5, 'backpack', 3.14, 100];

const onlyNumbers = things.filter(thing => {
  return typeof thing === 'number';
});

console.log(onlyNumbers);

Iterators
The .map() Method
12 min

The second iterator we’re going to cover is .map(). When .map() is called on an array, it takes an argument of a callback function and returns a new array! Take a look at an example of calling .map():

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; 

const bigNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * 10;
});

.map() works in a similar manner to .forEach()— the major difference is that .map() returns a new array.

In the example above:

    numbers is an array of numbers.
    bigNumbers will store the return value of calling .map() on numbers.
    numbers.map will iterate through each element in the numbers array and pass the element into the callback function.
    return number * 10 is the code we wish to execute upon each element in the array. This will save each value from the numbers array, multiplied by 10, to a new array.

If we take a look at numbers and bigNumbers:

console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(bigNumbers); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Notice that the elements in numbers were not altered and bigNumbers is a new array.


.map and .filter return an array but DO NOT alter it's parent function


Iterators
The .filter() Method
10 min

Another useful iterator method is .filter(). Like .map(), .filter() returns a new array. However, .filter() returns an array of elements after filtering out certain elements from the original array. The callback function for the .filter() method should return true or false depending on the element that is passed to it. The elements that cause the callback function to return true are added to the new array. Take a look at the following example:

const words = ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 

const shortWords = words.filter(word => {
  return word.length < 6;
});

    words is an array that contains string elements.
    const shortWords = declares a new variable that will store the returned array from invoking .filter().
    The callback function is an arrow function that has a single parameter, word. Each element in the words array will be passed to this function as an argument.
    word.length < 6; is the condition in the callback function. Any word from the words array that has fewer than 6 characters will be added to the shortWords array.

Let’s also check the values of words and shortWords:

console.log(words); // Output: ['chair', 'music', 'pillow', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']; 
console.log(shortWords); // Output: ['chair', 'music', 'brick', 'pen', 'door']

Observe how words was not mutated, i.e. changed, and shortWords is a new array.


simple small number filter 

const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below
const smallNumbers = randomNumbers.filter(number => {
  if (number < 150) {
    return number;
  }
});

console.log(smallNumbers);



Iterators
The .findIndex() Method
10 min

We sometimes want to find the location of an element in an array. That’s where the .findIndex() method comes in! Calling .findIndex() on an array will return the index of the first element that evaluates to true in the callback function.

const jumbledNums = [123, 25, 78, 5, 9]; 

const lessThanTen = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num < 10;
});

    jumbledNums is an array that contains elements that are numbers.
    const lessThanTen = declares a new variable that stores the returned index number from invoking .findIndex().
    The callback function is an arrow function that has a single parameter, num. Each element in the jumbledNums array will be passed to this function as an argument.
    num < 10; is the condition that elements are checked against. .findIndex() will return the index of the first element which evaluates to true for that condition.

Let’s take a look at what lessThanTen evaluates to:

console.log(lessThanTen); // Output: 3 

If we check what element has index of 3:

console.log(jumbledNums[3]); // Output: 5

Great, the element in index 3 is the number 5. This makes sense since 5 is the first element that is less than 10.

If there isn’t a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then .findIndex() will return -1.

const greaterThan1000 = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num > 1000;
});

console.log(greaterThan1000); // Output: -1

Awesome job on clearing the iterators lesson! You have learned a number of useful methods in this lesson as well as how to use the JavaScript documentation from the Mozilla Developer Network to discover and understand additional methods. Let’s review!

    .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.
    .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
    .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
    .findIndex() returns the index of the first element of an array that satisfies a condition in the callback function. It returns -1 if none of the elements in the array satisfies the condition.
    .reduce() iterates through an array and takes the values of the elements and returns a single value.
    All iterator methods take a callback function, which can be a pre-defined function, a function expression, or an arrow function.
    You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).

Debugging JavaScript Code
JavaScript Error Types
4 min

Now that you can identify the type of error from an error stack trace, you might be wondering what the different types of errors mean.

Here are three common error types:

    SyntaxError: This error will be thrown when a typo creates invalid code — code that cannot be interpreted by the compiler. When this error is thrown, scan your code to make sure you properly opened and closed all brackets, braces, and parentheses and that you didn’t include any invalid semicolons.
    ReferenceError: This error will be thrown if you try to use a variable that does not exist. When this error is thrown, make sure all variables are properly declared.
    TypeError: This error will be thrown if you attempt to perform an operation on a value of the wrong type. For example, if we tried to use a string method on a number, it would throw a TypeError.
